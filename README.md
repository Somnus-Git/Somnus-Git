- 👋 Hi, I’m @Somnus-Git

- 👀 I’m interested in primarily software engineering and full stack development. I like to be aware of the full scope of projects and understand how and why everything is happening
      from one point in the code to the other.
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can get my hands on.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects of all sizes, preferably in Python, Java, JavaScript, C++.
